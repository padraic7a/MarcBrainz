# MarcBrainz
A reasonably easy way to create marc records for Music CDs

This is a python script which scans a text field of barcodes and fetches details of the appropiate CDs using the MusicBrainz API. It returns results in both spredsheet (csv) and marc record (mrc) formats.

## How to use

You'll need to register a [user-agent](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Rate_Limiting#Provide_meaningful_User-Agent_strings) with MusicBrainz to avoid [rate-limiting](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Rate_Limiting).

[Back in 2010](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/marc-must-die) Roy Tennant told us that "Marc must die" and it's problems ahve been well documented. Music CDs have been terminal appearing decline for years. These zombie technologies remain with us, and what do zombies love? ... Brainz!
